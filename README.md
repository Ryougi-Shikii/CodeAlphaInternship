# PROJECT: Disease Prediction from Medical Data 
Objective: Predict the possibility of diseases based on patient data. 
Approach: Apply classification techniques to structured medical datasets. 
Key Features: 
● Use features like symptoms, age, blood test results, etc. 
● Algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost. 
● Datasets: Heart disease, Diabetes, Breast Cancer (UCI ML Repository). 

# PROJECT: Handwritten Character Recognition 
Objective: Identify handwritten characters or alphabets. 
Approach: Use image processing and deep learning. 
Key Features: 
● Dataset: MNIST (digits), EMNIST (characters). 
● Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
● Extendable to full word or sentence recognition with sequence modeling (like CRNN).

# PROJECT: Emotion Recognition from Speech 
Objective: Recognize human emotions (e.g., happy, angry, sad) from speech audio. 
Approach: Apply deep learning and speech signal processing techniques. 
Key Features: 
● Extract features like MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). 
● Use models like CNN, RNN, or LSTM. 
● Datasets: RAVDESS, TESS, or EMO-DB.
